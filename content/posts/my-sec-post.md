## Access to digital archives in Latvia.


There are multiple archives and museums in Latvia that offer the possibility to access their materials online.

The first one is [The National Archives of Latvia](https://www.arhivi.gov.lv/default.aspx?lang=EN)
where there are available handwritten materials sine the 18th century.
One of the materials that are appealing to many people is the census of inhabitants of Latvia from the 18th and 19th century
until the middle of the 20th century. All of these materials are available for anyone interested the only thing that the needs 
to be done is registration. It all sounds very appealing for people who would be interested in their family history or history 
of someplace or region. The biggest problem with these materials is that they are handwritten and, often with more than one 
language in one sheet of paper. People have been invited to participate in rewriting of these materials, but as far as I know, 
this has not been very popular and the materials are still readable only by choosing the church of a region one is interested 
in than flipping manually through the church books.
