## Access to digital archives in Latvia.


There are multiple archives and museums in Latvia that offer the possibility to access their materials online.

The first one is [The National Archives of Latvia](https://www.arhivi.gov.lv/default.aspx?lang=EN)
where there are available handwritten materials sine the 18th century.
One of the materials that are appealing to many people is the census of inhabitants of Latvia from the 18th and 19th century
until the middle of the 20th century. All of these materials are available for anyone interested the only thing that the needs 
to be done is registration. It all sounds very appealing for people who would be interested in their family history or history 
of someplace or region. The biggest problem with these materials is that they are handwritten and, often with more than one 
language in one sheet of paper. People have been invited to participate in rewriting of these materials, but as far as I know, 
this has not been very popular and the materials are still readable only by choosing the church of a region one is interested 
in than flipping manually through the church books.

Another freely available resource that is not an archive, but a library – National Library of Latvia. There is more than one 
database made available by the library. One that is very widely known and used is a database of old pictures called [Zudusī Latvija – Lost Latvia]( https://zudusilatvija.lv/).
In this database one cane find pictures of places in Latvia that over the years have changed and might not even be recognizable. 
Another tool which is connected to the text is [Periodika – Periodicals]( http://www.periodika.lv/). The materials in this database
are printed paper printed from 1748 till 2017. Since the materials are printed this database compared to the previous one has a big
advantage the materials can be computer-read much easier and thus also are searchable. Though there are some inaccuracies.

The third archive that I wanted to mention in this post is the reason why I am interested in this topic – [Digital Archives of Latvian Folklore garamantas.lv](http://garamantas.lv/) 
and I have been working in this archive for more than five years. The aim of the digital archives of the ALF is to make the material
 from the holdings of the Archives of Latvian Folklore, namely – manuscripts, images, audio and video recordings, and other valuable 
collections of folklore material – available online and readily usable. The digitizing of the archives has been happening for more 
than five years, this includes scanning, adding metadata, describing collection etc. And on of the aspects is the transcription of 
the scanned text pictures. Most of the materials are handwritten and by many different people with various [handwritings]( http://garamantas.lv/en/file/905047).
The option that our archive chose to make these materials searchable and thus the archive more appealing to people was crowdsourcing. 
By making instructions, inviting people to rewrite materials through social media, making activities and challenges to people and also
developing platform that is only used for this purpose. The digital archive itself is quite filled with information, different sections,
a lot of metadata and people can get confused, because of that platform [Simtgades burtnieki]( http://lv100.garamantas.lv/) was made 
where there is only the basic information about rewriting of texts and no other materials, such as picture or audio files are available. 
In the 18th od December at 9pm there are 141 964 pages transcribed (Form now 829 313 digitaly available pages) . Most of the work is done by around 20 people who have been permanent 
transcribes for many years.
