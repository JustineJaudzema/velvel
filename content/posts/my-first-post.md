### Computer-readable text in Latvian

Digital humanities is an interdisciplinary area of scholarly activity where digital
technologies and humanities are combined. The use of computational methods for research
has been a big part of humanities in past few decades all over the world. Unfortunately, in
Latvia, using digital methods in research is not as common, although the environment for
such a research is widely developed – books, newspapers and archival materials are
available in digital format. And with this, I mean that the materials are being digitized, 
but there is a lot more to do to make those computer-readable and much more widely available 
for researchers and anyone interested.

In this blog, I wanted to look at how these materials could become more available and usable
for anyone that has an interest, because until now there are several archives and museums in 
Latvia that have scanned and made their materials available for a wider audience, but since the 
text materials are not computer-readable they can be looked at the same way they could be in 
an archive.
