## Text Recognition for Latvian language.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a system that provides a full alphanumeric recognition of printed
or handwritten characters by simply scanning the text image and is considered a field of research in 
Artificial Intelligence. This system has made it possible to convert texts that are typed and handwritten
into texts usable by the computer. “OCR is a technology that functions like human ability of reading. 
OCR is not able to compete with human reading capabilities. OCR is a technology that enables you to convert
different types of documents such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital
camera into editable and searchable data.” [^1]
OCR can be useful for scholars in different humanities fields such as literature, linguistics and history
 because this gives an opportunity to have a large quantity of texts in pictures converted into computer-readable
 texts that in other circumstances would require a large number of human-power to rewrite. One reason why OCR is
 significant now is because digital humanities, the use of digital technologies by the humanities researchers has
 advanced quite quickly and digitization of materials is growing in large numbers it is important to have a possibility
 to access the materials so that they would not be available only as picture of materials, but become searchable
 and digitally editable.
It would be great if the Latvian language would have tools that would provide a good quality OCR. Although there are many
tools that are easily accessible these tools for a language that has many diacritical signs do not work as well
as for the English language. I am sure that the National Library of Latvia uses some kind of an OCR system that recognizes
the texts from periodicals, but it still has some inaccuracies and mistakes.
The most challenging part of the text automatic text recognition is handwritten materials. That is where Handwritten text recognition (HTR)
comes in. It recognizes the words in the text the difference between the two being segmentation. There are some tools like 
[Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus) that offer a possibility to make a training dataset. In the
description of Transkribus it says that the tool needs at least 75 pages or 15 00 words to work. But this number could probably
work with only one person's handwriting dataset. 

There is a possibility and need in DH for an automated text recognition to grow. As we can see the tools, systems and technologies
are developing very fast and this gives a hope that there will soon be a possibility of automated handwritten text recognition.


P.S. - Latvia has it's own [HUGO - Hugo.lv](https://hugo.lv/en/About) is a Latvian state administration language technology platform that is freely accessible
 to every resident of Latvia. It provides automatic translation, speech recognition and speech synthesis, as well as a range of 
tools for supporting multilingual features in e-services.

Hugo.lv is customized to the Latvian language and state administration documents, thus, its translation quality is much higher than in other online 
translation services. Furthermore, users of Hugo.lv can enjoy the services of the translation assistant for more convenient translation.
